# ProducerConsumer

This is a condensed version of one of my homework assignments from an operating systems course I took. Our task was to implement a solution to the producer-consumer problem in Java. I utilized the syncronized methods feature of Java in order to accomplish this task.

This is not meant to demonstrate much of my Java experience as it's a pretty simple problem. But I thought it was a good display of my code style, and it at least shows that I have some intermediate experience with Java.
